# HealthInsurance_Dashboard
### Health Insurance Desktop and Mobile Dashboards built as exercise during Data Science Academy's Power BI course.

These are the dataset and Dashboards I`ve built during the fifth chapter of [Data Science Academy's Power BI Course](https://www.datascienceacademy.com.br/course?courseid=microsoft-power-bi-para-data-science) as a case study. For more information on it check my Medium post [Answering Questions with Mobile Dashboards on Health Insurance](https://medium.com/@douglas.rochedo/answering-questions-with-mobile-dashboards-on-health-insurance-fbca804a6195).

PS: Data Science Acadamy is a Brazilian course given in Portuguese, thus, all of the content provided by the course is in Portuguese. All content in English is made by me and I shall not translate everything to English. So, if you want to understand better what I have done here, it is best you check the Medium post than try to understand from the content available here.
